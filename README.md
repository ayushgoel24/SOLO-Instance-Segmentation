# Segmentation using SOLO

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the instance segmentation model using the SOLO algorithm. The model leverages Pytorch Lightning to enhance maintainability and scalability of the training process, while focusing on the efficiency and effectiveness of segmenting objects in images.

## Pipeline
The project follows these steps:
1. Data Preparation: Dataset acquisition and preprocessing.
2. Model Development: Designing the SOLO architecture and integrating with Pytorch Lightning.
3. Training and Validation: Using Pytorch Lightning for efficient training and validation.
4. Evaluation: Testing the model and computing segmentation metrics.
5. Optimization and Tuning: Hyperparameter adjustments and model refinement.
6. Deployment: Exporting the model and setting up an inference pipeline.
7. Monitoring and Maintenance: Performance checks and model updates.
